# Learning Python

__tommy teaches tommy__ (and anyone who wants to actually read this) how to code in Python, with a major focus on all the functionality available in the Python Standard Library (PSL).

I've been doing various amounts of Python coding since 2009-ish in personal, professional, and academic projects, but you're never too old to learn, and they keep making computers better and worse all the time.

Currently in 2023, I'd say that Python is my preferred programming language and the one in which I feel most experienced.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

_"What's in a name?"_

You can see a rambly explanation [here at my personal website](https://tommypkeane.com/about-tommy/tommy-teaches-tommy.html); but, in short:

I'm just trying to say that I'm writing out what I think is helpful/interesting to me, and I'm sharing it in case it's helpful to anyone else, but please know that I'm ___not___ trying to talk _down_ to anyone :smile: (except maybe myself :ghost:).
