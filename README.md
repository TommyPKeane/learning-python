# Learning Python

Tommy teaches Tommy (and anyone who wants to actually read this) how to code in Python.

I've been doing various amounts of Python coding since 2009-ish in personal, professional, and academic projects, but you're never too old to learn, and they keep making computers better and worse all the time.

Currently in 2023, I'd say that Python is my preferred programming language and the one in which I feel most experienced.

## Common Setup

This repo relies on `pyenv` and `direnv` to create directory-local "projects", which establish a fixed, local instance of Python to use as an isolated interpreter (runtime) where we can keep all our dependencies isolated.

The major benefit of this approach is that we avoid the disconnect of Docker, and enforces an encapsulated development environment that can be shared between developers and more easily productionalized _via_ Docker or some other deployment.

In macOS you can setup the tools with `brew` using the following commands:

- `brew install direnv`
- `brew install pyenv`

In each project directory there will be four common files:

- `.python-version`: Version of Python (per `pyenv`) in use
- `.envrc`: `direnv` Configuration File
- `pyproject.toml`: Project and Package Dependencies Management
- `poetry.toml`: Poetry Configuration Options
- `poetry.lock`: Dependency Lock File (hashes etc.)

As such, you'll note that almost all the `.envrc` configuration files for `direnv` look like this:

```bash
# direnv Config File
#
# https://direnv.net/
# https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

python_version=$(cat "./.python-version")

layout pyenv "${python_version}"
```

As a pre-cursor to calling `direnv allow`, you should make sure that you have the appropriate version of Python installed through `pyenv` by calling `pyenv install` in the same directory as the `.python-version` file.

The common setup steps for each directory will follow this sequence:

1. `pyenv install` (Optional)
1. `direnv allow`
1. `pip install --upgrade pip`
1. `pip install poetry`
1. `poetry install`

Arguably, you can install a system-level version of `poetry`, to avoid incremental updates, similar to `direnv` and `pyenv`, but that's really only going to be a consideration in a team-based development environment or in professional software when you need to prioritize stability and repeatability.

Another alternative to a system-level version of `poetry` is also to just enforce a version constraint when you install `poetry` by using a command like `pip install poetry==1.2.3`, where `1.2.3` is the version you want to "lock" your Project to.

### Why Not Docker?

What's with `direnv` and `pyenv`? Do you really need those? Why not just work directly in Docker?

You can, if you want -- you can do anything you want, I'm definitely not in charge ðŸ‘».

If you're asking why would I suggest avoiding Docker, I'd say that there's a complexity of system resource management, caching, publishing, and logging that are all complicated by using Docker. These are things that can all be overcome, even if they're innate to a Dockerized deployment, but that's where the effort should be focused on the deployment itself and not necessarily the code/app being deployed.

It's essentially a recommendation for a "separation of duties". If you think about writing a book, you have the content of the book (the text), but then you also have the typography and typesetting/layout of how the book is paginated and ultimately printed. As best as possible, it's beneficial to separate those two things, so that you can just focus on content and then worry about presentation afterwards. Things can go very wrong if you overly "tie" your content to your media/medium, because then it's not a separable and configurable presentation layer, it's then a fundamental assumption/requirement of the content itself.

Obviously, we can't solve everything, so we have to pick and choose our battles. So, in that sense, in my experience, there's a nice happy middle-ground by developing in Python with `direnv`, `pyenv`, and `poetry`, and then using Docker or some other system runtime management tooling to establish the production version.
