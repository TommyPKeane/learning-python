# Learning Python

__tommy teaches tommy__ (and anyone who wants to actually read this) how to code in Python, with a major focus on all the functionality available in the Python Standard Library (PSL).

I've been doing various amounts of Python coding since 2009-ish in personal, professional, and academic projects, but you're never too old to learn, and they keep making computers better and worse all the time.

Currently in 2023, I'd say that Python is my preferred programming language and the one in which I feel most experienced.

## What's this "tommy teaches tommy" thing all about?

Hi, I'm the tommy; it's me. __tommy teaches tommy__ is just a phrase I like to use to summarize, categorize, collect, and explain my personal style of writing for any kinds of tutorial, referential, or theoretical documentation.

<details>
  <summary>More details (ramblings)...</summary>

  Outside of the innate narcissism and suspected solipsism, I prefer this phrase as a way to clarify and preface that what I'm sharing and writing is directed at myself as the audience. I'm teaching myself this topic, whether I know it already or not.

  I want to clarify that, because I am preemptively anxiously concerned that my writing-style would otherwise come across as a disrespectful "know it all". I'm really, honestly not trying to be a jerk. But, I sometimes actually do kinda know what I'm talking about ... that's as much as I'll admit.

  I may know a lot or a little, I may be seeing and saying all this for the first time, or I may have spent decades dealing with this topic. Either way, I want to teach (and re-teach) myself by trying to explain it to myself until I hit a level of verifiable detail where I'm like "Yeah, totally. That makes sense. Oh, and neat diagrams! I loves it! Great job, tommy!", or something similar.

  And I want that to be a warning to anyone who reads this or references what I'm sharing. I don't say that to mean that I think this is useless, I just want to encourage caution in taking what I say as totally, entirely, fundamentally, perfectly correct. And, even if I'm still figuring it out, or if I got it right, I just honestly hope it's useful to anyone who finds this and reads any of this.

  I want to be an advocate for transparency and the sharing of information. In all honesty, I probably have a neurotic compulsion to want to know and learn everything; but I don't want to hoard any information or knowledge. I really think we can all learn everything, and while I'm entertaining myself with all this, I just want to share it openly and transparently.

  But, again, that's all with the caveat that maybe I got some of this wrong, maybe I misunderstood, or maybe I've talked myself into a false rationalization that I haven't realized yet.

  So, this is __tommy teaches tommy__ -- adverb laden, overly confidently written, and ever-evolving reference materials on various topics with solipsistic priorities and varying degrees of quality.

  But please feel free to use any of this for yourself, and you're more than welcome to secretly/silently watch me flail here out in the open, or go ahead and reach out if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, corrections, or whatever. Just please also take it all with a bit of safety-conscious cynicism ("trust but verify") before you use any of the information here to do anything important.
