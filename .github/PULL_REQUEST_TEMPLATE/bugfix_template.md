# Bugfix Changeset

> _This Pull-Request addresses a previously known or newly discovered bug (issue) in the codebase, in terms of something that was implemented in a way that either doesn't match the expected design or doesn't do what the original author thought they were implementing._

## Issue Summary

> _[üëª‚úçÔ∏è] The summary of the issue being addressed by this changeset should be described here or a link to documentation with a brief explanation should be provided here. Even if you're linking to external documentation, it's preferable to give a short summary so that people don't have to jump around everywhere to understand the context. A little bit of repetition is appreciated when it can save a lot of frustration._

## Proposed Solution(s)

> _[üëª‚úçÔ∏è] This section should give a brief summary (a bullet-point list is good, too) of the overall set of changes being presented here, in reference to how they're going to fix the issue mentioned above. Even if the changes seem obvious in the code, it's good to summarize here in non-code, so that it's really clear what the intentions are. If there's any disagreement about the changes or the issue itself, it's best to first make sense there's a shared understanding of the summary of the issue and the proposed solution, as there's probably more than one solution when looking only at the code._

## Testing Updates

> _[üëª‚úçÔ∏è] Bugs and issues in the codebase usually mean that there was a lack of testing, or that something was failing in the testing, so it's likely that an update to the testing is needed. Even if all the testing is working, if something was missed, then that gap should be closed so that the same issue can't reoccur and be missed. If there's a changeset for a bugfix and there's no enhancement or update to the tests, then it should be explained here as to why there were no changes needed. If the bugfix is only to documentation with no code changes, it's probably better to use the `documentation_template.md` Pull-Request Template._

## Proof of Solution(s)

> _[üëª‚úçÔ∏è] Here, for yourself and reviewers, you should prove that the changeset has fixed the issue. If the solution can't be proven without accepting and merging this changeset, then please use the üö® emoji and explain why that is. Reviewers shouldn't approve any changeset for a bugfix unless this section is filled-out._

## Template Legend

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that the template uses Markdown blockquote sections with the greater-than symbol `>` for visual styling. When editing the template, these sections should go away, per the template, and you should be using general Markdown syntax to style your new text.

- "Repository" refers to the concept of this shared distributed version-controlled project, referred to by the name of the repository here on this GitHub account. This version on GitHub is the "remote" repository (repo), and the version on any developer's computer (their clone) is the "local" repository
- "Changeset" refers to this branch of code that's being presented as a coherent set of changes (commits) to make to the repository; GitHub's terminology for a changeset is "Pull Request"
- [üëª‚úçÔ∏è] means: Replace or overwrite this section
- ‚ö†Ô∏è means: Warning or Note, to call-out something important in this wall of text
- üö® means: Alert, to call-out a critical issue or concern that persists or will exist due to this changeset
